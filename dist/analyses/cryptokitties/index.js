    title: "General",
    content: "Launched back in 2017 by Dapper Labs, now known for their development of NBA Topshot, Cryptokitties was the first NFT project to gain mainstream recognition. Only 50,000 Gen 0 kitties were initially created during its launch but the game incorporated breeding mechanics: two kitties are capable of breeding, increasing the supply of new kitties. Furthermore, traits from both parents such as fur type and color can be passed down to each new generation, and some traits were only unlocked through the randomized breeding. The amount of time required for kitties to breed a new generation is called the “cooldown”, which increases for each successive offspring, a mechanic designed to preserve the value of more lower generation denominated breeds. Now, there are over 2M kitties in existence, all with a unique combination of traits and attributes."
  }, {
    title: "Cultural Significance",
    content: "During its peak years, Cryptokitties received wide coverage from a variety of media types such as Wall St Journal, CNBC, and NY Times. For most, Cryptokitties was their first introduction towards the NFT community. Cryptokitties accounted for over 25% of Ethereum network volume and caused severe network congestion."
  }, {
    title: "Valuation Techniques",
    content: "Bred kitties that discover new “Mewtated” genes receive a Diamond Gem denoting their scarce trait and are widely known to the be the most valuable kitties in the game. There are only 243 of these Diamond kitties in existence and many never see the secondary market. Founder kitties (with mint number below 100) also carry premiums to their valuation."
  }, {
    title: "Market Watch",
    content: "Currently, the floor price for a Diamond Gem kitty is 11 ETH.. In January of 2021, Kitty #1121273 holding a Diamond Gem for the Mewtated traited of “Kaleidoscope” eye color sold for 100 ETH. Previously, the highest recorded sale for a Diamond Gem kitty was 25 ETH. While volume has cooled down from its peak activity from 2017-18, Cryptokitties still ranks inside the top 20 for total project volume."
  }, {
    title: "Risk",
    content: "Cryptocurrencies are inherently risky, and emerging asset classes like NFTs are no exception towards the rule. In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
