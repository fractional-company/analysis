            content: "Chromie Squiggles is the premier project of Erick Calderon, also known as Snowfro & the founder of Art Blocks. The project contains 10,000 algorithmically generated squiggly lines with different colors, patterns, slopes, inflection points, and a host of other variables. Perfect spectrum squiggles are amongst the most rare, with only 20 minted. They feature a rainbow palette and an evenly distributed range of colors."

            content: "Generative art is a genre that sits at the intersection of mathematics and aesthetics. Typically, generative artists take algorithms and data structures to translate alphanumeric characters into specific design language. For Chromie Squiggles, a hash string from the Ethereum block from which the NFT is minted is the alphanumeric input used.The result is an unpredictable and unforeseeable collection of designs and scarcities that only can be analyzed after the entire minting is completed."

Recently, community members including founder Erick Calderon, banded together to create Squiggle DAO, a grassroots organization designed to curate adjacent projects, offer grants for developers & artists, and fund community events."

In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
