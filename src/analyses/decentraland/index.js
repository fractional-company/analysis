There are numerous minigames, casinos, and arcades scattered through DCLâ€™s virtual world amongst the 90,000 different plots of LAND. While many factors affect their valuation, LAND near Genesis Plaza consistently carries the most value. The community also prefers lands along roads, with intersections and corners, especially valuable."

Wearables and accessories, purchasable through the DCL in-game currency $MANA, are limited by rarity. Ranging from commons (100k cap) down to one of one Uniques, users design their avatars to showcase their personality and perhaps flex their wealth. "

            content: "Historically, Decentraland LAND has consistently ranked as the highest volume virtual world platform by both total value and number of transactions. Unlike other metaverses that tend to price their property in $ETH, LAND in Decentraland is exclusively valued in its native currency $MANA. This past month has seen sales range from 2000 MANA up to 125,000 MANA. Like other virtual worlds, pricing for LAND varies tremendously and is heavily dependent on location."

Valuations can fluctuate on a variety of outside factors on both the macro level (metaverse traffic) and micro level (the contents of adjacent lands). Collectors should be aware of these risks."
