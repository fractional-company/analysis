            title: "Profile",
            content: "While perhaps not as prolific as some of his peers, XCOPY replaces quantity with quality of the highest order. Known for his glitchy, high frame rate, looped animations, the London-based digital artist has an aesthetic that can be identified at an instant. His highly recognizable pieces tend to feature abstract portraits drawn ostensibly with a digital crayon. Often relying on motifs such as skulls, ghouls, and assorted shrouded, hooded characters, XCOPY often explores themes of death, chaos, and anxiety."

            title: "Cultural Significance",
            content: "No stranger to satire as a form of social commentary, XCOPY often takes aim at critics with iconic pieces <i>Right-click</i> and <i>Save Guy</i> and <i>This Is Clearly Money Laundering</i>. His tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation is salient through his entire collection. XCOPY’s participation within the crypto community from the very beginning is widely appreciated by both his peers and his collectors. "

April, 2021 was a busy month that might have cemented XCOPY’s place in the Mouth Rushmore of NFTs.  Within the same month,  <a href='https://superrare.co/artwork/death-dip-14' target='_blank' className='underline'>Death Dip</a> sold for 1000 ETH, <a href='https://superrare.co/artwork/reflection-12' target='_blank' className='underline'>Reflection</a> sold for 475 ETH and <a href='https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/hope-10497' target='_blank' className='underline'>Hope</a> sold for 250 ETH, capping a whirlwind of volume for the eccentric artist. In July, 2021 a prominent NFT collector purchased Hello Admin, PM Me for 175 ETH."

In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
