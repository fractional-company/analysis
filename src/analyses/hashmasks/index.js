            title: "General",
            content: "The Hashmasks is a collection of 16,384 unique pieces that were created by over 70 anonymous artists. The characters, backgrounds, and traits are subtle and not-so-subtle references towards famous artists, authors, musicians, and mathematicians. Hashmasks were the first notable project to use a pricing curve model for distribution. There were separate pricing tiers where the price of each mask increased as each tranche filled up. A distinguishing aspect of Hashmask ownership is that, unlike some of its peers, owners possess all digital rights for both personal and commercial use."

            title: "Explicit & Implicit Traits",
            content: "Each Hashmask, while randomly generated, is a composition of various traits with published scarcity statistics. There are 165 Golden Robots, for example, which account for 1% of the total supply. After the project’s reveal, however, users noticed that not every trait was accounted for statistically and that some very rare traits were camouflaged within the art itself. This sparked a week-long manhunt as the community tried to figure out the secret implicit traits and easter eggs disguised within the masks. Some hidden implicit traits like glyphs are fairly common; however, others like crowns (6), halos (20), and phoenixes (37) are extremely rare and masks with these traits are valued appropriately on the secondary market."

            title: "Cultural Significance",
            content: "Perhaps the key differentiator for The Hashmasks is the ability for owners to name their masks on the blockchain. Some owners have opted for pop culture references, others have named their masks after crypto community icons, while some are just seemingly random. However, owners cannot change the name as often as they’d like.  The Hashmaks is one of the few NFT projects to have a token associated with it. With a fixed total supply, $NCT (Name Changing Token) is generated for owners of each mask. Hashmasks owners are required to burn $NCT (Name Changing Token) to name or rename their mask."

This rare piece is a one of 12 Mystical characters, featuring a Unique mask (one of 10) and Mystical eyes (one of 12). Additionally, this Mask is part of the Halo set (one of 20), one of the most desirable hidden, implicit traits in the collection."
