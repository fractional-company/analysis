            content: "Released on 5/3/21, Meebits is the third project of Larva Labs and features a collection of 20,000 fully rendered characters who ostensibly will act as avatars or characters skins in a future virtual world. Like its predecessor Cryptopunks, Meebits come in a variety of character types with a diverse collection of clothing and accessories. The dissected character type is by far the most scarce, with only four (so far) in existence. Visitors, Skeletons, and Robots are among the more desirable types. While Humans are the most common type, certain clothing items and accessories can add significant value; Meebits equipped with hoodies and 3D glasses are already selling for a premium on the secondary markets."

            title: "Distribution",
            content: "While Cryptopunks themselves were completely free releases, Meebits adopted a hybrid model of distribution. Cryptopunk and Autoglyph owners were reserved a free Meebits mint free of charge, accounting for up to 11,000 Meebits. The remaining 9,0000 were sold on a Dutch auction format, starting at 2.5 ETH and selling out by the time the price reached 2.41 ETH."

As it turned out, a community member was able to exploit the LL minting contract and minted an additional Visitor. Within the first day, it had traded hands twice: selling for 200 ETH and then once again for 299 ETH."

In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
