For the original owner, fractionalizing provides increased liquidity and quicker, more efficient price discovery, while reducing volatility. Secondly, it allows buyers either priced out of certain pieces, or those who want to diversify their portfolio over a more broad collection, the ability to do so."

In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution. "
