            content: "There are numerous benefits of fractionalizing NFTs. For the original owner, fractionalizing provides increased liquidity and quicker, more efficient price discovery, while reducing volatility. Secondly, it allows buyers either priced out of certain pieces, or those who want to diversify their portfolio over a more broad collection, the ability to do so."

About â…” of that figure is through primary sales, while the rest is accounted for from secondary sales. A more bullish indicator is the 30 day moving average for the amount of active wallets, which has remained steady from March to June, even with decreased trading volume. Over 27,000 unique wallets bought or sold an NFT during the month."

In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
