            content: "Though debuting nearly eight years ago through several previous iterations, The Sandbox converted into an Ethereum-based metaverse project encouraging community interaction,  creating a social hub full of attractions and digital content. Throughout the virtual world, users can visit shopping malls, amusement parks, and concert venues. The Sandbox economy includes land, avatars, wearables, and art which can be purchased on their own marketplace as well as third party platforms like OpenSea, allowing users to customize their characters and their experience."

            title: "Cultural Significance",
            content: "One of the key differentiators separating the Sandbox from other crypto metaverses is their willingness to collaborate with adjacent projects. Leveraging partnerships with Gemini & Nifty Gateway, Binance, and CoinMarketCap, as well as artists like Pranksy and Deadmau5, Sandbox utilizes these brands to provide exclusive, limited edition in-game assets and wearables."

            title: "Metrics",
            content: "Since the debut of their own secondary marketplace in April, the project has seen a sharp uptick in both primary sales and trading volume. Though previously sitting outside the top 20 of NFT volume, Sandbox now comfortably sits within the top 10 in overall volume, accumulating over $37M in total sales, with the majority of it coming in the past 8 weeks. In June, a 24x24 plot of land sold for $650k, a figure three times higher than the previous record. Sales remain strong, with two 12x12 plots recently selling for $287k and 281k respectively."

Valuations can fluctuate on a variety of outside factors on both the macro level (metaverse traffic) and micro level (the contents of adjacent lands). Collectors should be aware of these risks."
