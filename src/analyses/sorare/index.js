            content: "A hybrid between a collectible card game and fantasy sports, Sorare brings a challenging gamification aspect to the NFT sports collectibles scene. Users are able to purchase playing cards of their favorite soccer -- erhm, football -- players to create 5-a-side teams to compete against others for rewards. Each player has four rarities: common (unlimited), rare (numbered to 100), super rare (numbered to 10), and unique (one of a kind), with the higher rarity levels providing multiplying scoring effects. Players receive points based on real world performances including midweek Champions League and Copa Libertadores matches. Players carry over from one season to the next so owning a promising young superstar such as Kylian Mbappe card, for example, could provide benefits for the duration of the player’s career. There are various separate leagues to compete in including European, Asian, and American football leagues."

            title: "Cultural Significance",
            content: "With football being by far the most popular sport, Sorare is truly a global game. Their licenses include fan favorites Real Madrid, Liverpool, and Paris Saint Germain among other giants of the game. Because of the fantasy sports element, these cards have gained utility beyond collecting the players themselves. Tracking your team across their weekly games provides an interactive experience reminiscent of DraftKings and Fanduel tournaments."

In February of 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Unique card sold for 53 ETH. Consistently ranking in the top 10 for NFT volume, Sorare collectibles traded for over 3400 ETH in volume."

            title: "Risk",
            content: "Because the players’ scores are determined by real world performance, there are higher levels of variance associated with this type of investment. Long term injuries can severely affect the valuations of the players’ cards. To a lesser degree, coaching decisions and tactics may not be consistent from game to game. Lastly, each season mints an additional set of cards (111 in total) so while they are distributed even through each season, they are inflationary by design."
