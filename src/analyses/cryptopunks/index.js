            content: "In 2017, Larva Labs released what is now widely recognized as the most iconic NFT collection: a set of 10,000 8-bit characters each randomly generated with unique, distinguishing features and accessories. None of the 24x24 pixel punks are alike. The most desirable types include Aliens (x/9), Apes (x/24), and Zombies (x/88), while certain accessories like hoodies and 3D glasses are fiercely sought after. Astute collectors will also value specific edge case rarities such as a specific number of attributes, among other nuanced valuation techniques."

Notably, this is also the only Alien with a sub-1000 series number. Conservative projections for the auction estimate the value to be between $7M to $9M. Not to be outdone, Sotheby’s is mirroring its rival by planning its own Punk auction. #7523, an Alien punk with a mask, beanie, and earring is one of the most desirable Punks in existence and set to sell in an auction setting in June."

While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
