            content: "Somnium Space is an Ethereum-based virtual world accessible via web browser or through major VR headset platforms like Rift, VIVE, & Oculus. Of all the metaverses, the Somnium geography bears the closest resemblance to the real world, with waterfront and island properties fetching a premium against their in-land counterparts. Community members regularly host events including things like treasure hunts, virtual concerts, and charity fundraisers. Usage metrics have been consistently rising, with Somnium recently surpassing 100,000 unique visitors."

            content: "Somniumâ€™s competitive advantage is their focus on asset monetization:  they feature their own in-game currency ($CUBE) and also  allows users to tokenize their avatars, the first metaverse to do so. Their development of their own economy has encouraged creative parcel owners to design their buildings to provide utility and earn passive income."

As of May 2021, M sized parcels were selling between 10 and 20 ETH, though valuations are heavily dependent on parcel location."

Valuations can fluctuate on a variety of outside factors on both the macro level (metaverse traffic) and micro level (the contents of adjacent lands). Investors should be aware of these risks."
