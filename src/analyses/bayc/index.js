Capitalizing on ape meme culture, BAYC quickly cultivated a loyal community of supporters, with colorful and memorable design features that reference iconic NFT projects such as Cryptopunks and Hashmasks."

NBA stars Lamelo Ball & Tyrese Haliburton are just some of the famous collectors that can call themselves BAYC owners. In addition, BAYC merch, primarily spearhead by the community, has also demonstrated both strong primary and secondary sales."

Gold fur (x/46) and blue beam laser eyes (x/49) are two other desirable traits for collectors. Featureless naked apes, known as 4 trait apes, are also popular for BAYC enthusiasts. Total sales have skyrocketed this past month, with over $13M in volume, ranking as the 4th highest volume NFT collection during that time period. Overall, BAYC has traded about $26M, as of June 2021."
