            content: "Launching on May 1, 2021 for 0.08 ETH a piece, this collection of 10,000 uniquely generated cartoon apes became an instant sensation, selling out its entire allotment within a few hours. Capitalizing on ape meme culture, BAYC quickly cultivated a loyal community of supporters, with colorful and memorable design features that reference iconic NFT projects such as Cryptopunks and Hashmasks."

            content: "Despite such a recent release, BAYC is most known for developing one of the most ardent and enthusiastic supporters, with one of the highest trafficked Discords, as well being perfect for social media avatars.  NBA stars Lamelo Ball & Tyrese Haliburton are just some of the famous collectors that can call themselves BAYC owners. In addition, BAYC merch, primarily spearheaded by the community, has also demonstrated both strong primary and secondary sales."

            title: "Market Watch",
            content: "Gold fur (x/46) is perhaps the most sought after trait. BAYC #197 and #3749 both feature gold fur, and sold for 109 ETH and 105 ETH, becoming the highest sales within the collection. Trippy fur (x/77) and blue beam laser eyes (x/49) are two other desirable traits for collectors. Featureless naked apes, known as 4 trait apes, are also popular for BAYC enthusiasts. Total sales have skyrocketed since its release, with over $92M in volume, becoming the 4th highest NFT collection in sales volume of all time, a stunning feat for such a new project."
