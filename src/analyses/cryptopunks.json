None of the 24x24 pixel punks are alike. The most desirable types include Aliens (x/9), Apes (x/24), and Zombies (x/88), while certain accessories like hoodies and 3D glasses are fiercely sought after. Astute collectors will also value specific edge case rarities such as a specific number of attributes, among other nuanced valuation techniques."

    "content": "Christie’s auction house is set to auction a collection of 9 Cryptopunks with the centerpiece being #635, an Alien with a bandana and sunglasses. Notably, this is also the only Alien with a sub-1000 series number. Conservative projections for the auction estimate the value to be between $7M to $9M. Not to be outdone, Sotheby’s is mirroring its rival by planning its own Punk auction. #7523, an Alien punk with a mask, beanie, and earring is one of the most desirable Punks in existence and set to sell in an auction setting in June."
