Axie Infinity is a PvE & PvP tactical turn-based strategy game that shares gameplay similarities to Pokemon. Composed of three Axies, each team battles with a different variety of attacking and defensive moves until the opponent is defeated. Players can compete in tournaments that offer financial rewards."

            content: "The most rare and desirable Axies are Quad and Triple Mystics. The game launched with 4,088 Origin Axies and only 30% of those possess at least one mystic part. Of those, only 19 are of the Triple Mystic variety, while only 3 can be categorized at Quad Mystics. While Axies can breed to produce an inflationary amount as characters, Mystic traits are, quite importantly, not able to be transferred from one generation to the next, maintaining its scarcity in the ecosystem."

As of 5/21, there are actually no Triple and Quad Mystics listed on the secondary market. The lowest priced Double Mystic is currently 20 ETH. The game features over 22,000 active daily users and ranks as the most popular cryptocurrency game on the market. Currently, volume for the project is surging; Axie Infinity is ranked #1 in NFT volume for the past 30 days, bringing in over $46M in secondary sales, a figure that accounts for over half of its lifetime sales volume."

In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
