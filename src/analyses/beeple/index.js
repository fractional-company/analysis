            content: "With over 2M Instagram followers, Mike Winkelmann, more commonly known as Beeple, might have an argument as the most significant digital artist of all time. While he started his Everydays collection with hand drawings, he is more famously recognized by his 3D modeling and rendering, placing pop culture icons in dystopian states. Recently, his works have provided political commentary for the current climate and tackle themes like consumerism and selfishness. Beeple has distributed NFTs in a variety of formats including 1 of 1s, open editions, traditional & unique auction formats, and has even experimented with NFTs paired with physical pieces."

This sale garnered national attention including coverage from <i>CNBC, Wall Street Journal,</i> and<i> The New Yorker</i>."

In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
