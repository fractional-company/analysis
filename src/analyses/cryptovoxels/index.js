The buyer, MetaKovan, subsequently transferred ownership to B20’s portfolio; the plot of virtual land was used to build a monument dedicated to his record-breaking purchase of Beeple’s EVERYDAY NFT and features custom music from 3LAU. Visitors are able to view the complex as a celebration of B20’s works."
