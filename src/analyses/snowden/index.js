            content: "Created by renowned photographer Platon, Stay Free is the genesis NFT produced by Edward Snowden, celebrating the landmark court decision against the National Security Agency and its use of mass surveillance on individuals. Using images of the actual text of the ruling, Platon mapped out  a portrait of the whistleblower. At this time, this is the only NFT associated with Edward Snowden in existence."

            title: "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)",
            content: "While DAOs in the crypto community are usually associated with DeFi protocols, art collectors with common goals and unified visions have coalesced to form organizations based on curating collections of art, with shared ownership of its assets spread across its members. One such group is PleasrDAO, a spontaneously created DAO, that fought off fierce competition to win Stay Free at auction for 2,240 ETH. Proceeds from the auction were directed to the Freedom of the Press Foundation."

            title: "Cultural Significance",
            content: "<i>Stay Free</i> stresses the importance of transparency and freedom, which unsurprisingly resonates with the crypto community at large. The blockchain provides freedom from monetary systems, banking infrastructure, and financial intermediaries, all with the same transparency that Snowden champions.  Stay Free is an especially meaningful piece to members of the DAO; the message behind Stay Free aligns with the DAOâ€™s core beliefs, and fractionalizing this piece adheres to that ethos, allowing this piece to belong to the people."

            content: "Cryptocurrencies are inherently risky, and emerging asset classes like NFTs are no exception towards the rule. In fact, as a whole, this asset class may carry even higher volatility than other crypto assets. While the NFT space has seen strong momentum, that may not always be the case; research accordingly and proceed with caution."
